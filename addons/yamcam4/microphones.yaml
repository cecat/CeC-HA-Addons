# SAMPLE CONFIG FILE TO GET STARTED
# 
general:
  noise_threshold: 0.1       # Filter out very very low scores
  default_min_score: 0.5     # Default threshold for group scores (default 0.5)
                             # (must exceed this level for a sound event to be
                             # detected as starting or continuing)
  top_k: 10                  # Number of top scoring classes to analyze (default 10)
  log_level: INFO            # Default INFO. In order of decreasing verbosity:
                             # DEBUG->INFO->WARNING->ERROR->CRITICAL 
  sound_log: true            # Create CSV file in /medid/yamcam to log all class,
                             #   group, and event detections
                             #   analysis of trends (it gets big very fast, use carefully).
                             #   Default is false
  ffmpeg_debug: false        # Log ffmpeg stderr (a firehose - includes errors and info)
                             #   Must also have log_level set to DEBUG
  exclude_groups:            # Groups we don't want to report (or log), e.g., 
    - silence                #   the 'silence' group in particular can be noisy...
  summary_interval: 5        # log (INFO level) a summary every n minutes of the number
                             #   of sound groups detected.

# MQTT
# Fill in YOUR IP address for the broker (your HA server or other). 
# Fill in YOUR mqtt username and password
mqtt:
  host: "x.x.x.x"               # Your MQTT server (commonly the IP addr of your HA server)
  port: 1883                    # Default unless you specifically changed it in your broker
  topic_prefix: "yamcam/sounds" # adjust to your taste
  client_id: "yamcam"           # adjust to your taste (a "3" will be appended to avoid
                                # colliding with Yamcam2 (which also uses this file) and
                                # confusing MQTT.
  user: "mymqttusername"        # your mqtt username on your broker (e.g., Home Asst server) 
  password: "mymqttpassword"    #         & password

# EVENTS (define 'event' parameters)
events:
  window_detect: 5              # Number of samples (~1s each) to examine to determine 
                                #   if a sound is persistent.
  persistence: 2                # Number of detections within window_detect to consider
                                #   a sound event has started.
  decay: 10                     # Number of waveforms without the sound to consider 
                                #   the sound event has stopped.
